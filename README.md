# About me

![logo](images/Spookyrumble_text.png)

**Welcome to my Github, step into my newfound world of development.**

My is name, **Hans** aka **Spookyrumble** and I am a 41-year-old studying Front-End Development. After 20+ years working a variety of jobs which includes everything from fishing boats to service coordinator, I decided I wanted to pursue a long-forgotten dream of development. Life and family kind of put everything in the back seat for a while but here I am and I couldn't be happier!

**The portfolio is being remade. The following is my year one portfolio with year one projects:**

New projects includes a Pong like game I made using only Flutter. A Discord bot i made just to see if I could do it. It was made to simplify the job searching progress by getting the new listings from a application website and posting them in my Discord server. 
New School projects include JS frameworks, Vite, Tailwind. 
I will update all this when I finish my exams, but for now please feel free to look through my reposatories.

These are the projects I have been working on during my first year as a front-end student.
They are all designed, developed and programmed by myself.

## School projects

**All projects are stored on Github and Deployed with Netlify. It is as simple as clicking the link. I recommend browsing my repos because there are projects there that have not made it here yet.**

- **The Cross-course Assignment: "Rainydays"** is the first design and development we did. It has followed us through the year and has been developed as we went through the course modules.

  - [View GitHub repo](https://github.com/HMAsp/HTML-CSS_CA_HMA_2022)
  - [Visit the website on Netlify](https://chic-lollipop-939ca8.netlify.app/)

- **The semester project: CSM** put together what we learned the first semester. The biggest difference with this project compared with the cross-course is that this was heavily text-based while Rainydays is an e-commerce site.

- **Javascript1: Beer Recipes** is our first experience with JavaScript and working with APIs. We were to choose a free API and create a list and a dynamic details page.

* **Project Exam: "Inside the trip"** concludes our first year of studies. It brings together everything we have learned and then some as it holds some details we never learned but I was able to figure out and make work. Like the custom comment section and how to POST contact forms.
